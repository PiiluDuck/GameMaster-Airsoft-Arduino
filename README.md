# GameMaster-Airsoft-Arduino
Arduino Based GameMaster box with two gamemodes. 

Just a backup repository for the code I made for my Airsoft company indoor field. 
The origial code was resorced: https://github.com/yinbot/Airsoft-BombPro/tree/master/code/BombPro

The Original code was modified alot, most of the code was rewritten and adapted to our needs.
The current code has two game modes only, Search & Destroy and Domination, the password function was removed from code.
Many parts of the code was adapted and updated to work better with EPROM flash memomory, take into account this code was developed to work with Uno Rev3 Wifi integrated board. 
The board is not a native Arduino Board. 
Funtions for LED RING light were writter and animated.
The LCD screen was adapted to be I2C module. 

Wifi funtion is currently turned off as we decided not to impliment it fully currently, Blynk was the go to app, but we decided to halt that implimentation currently. 

If you decide to use the code, be aware that we dont endorse any copy paste method of selling any Built Arduino Game Boxes with this code.
This code is free for airsoft fields to use for their own use, I do not include any schematics as this is not the point of this resporitory. 
But if you are an airsoft arena deciding to use our code and have any questions, you can ask me kaimarlaiva [at] gmail.com
